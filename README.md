# F.nucleatum-project
Longitudinal analysis on fecal metagenomes of IBD and non-IBD subjects in a F. nucleuatm-oriented manner


# Explanation
- This project was desigend and performed by JW Huh with advices from TY Roh at POSTECH.
- This project used public database provided by integrative Human Microbiome Project (iHMP, http://ihmp.org)
- The resource is whole genome sequencing data of fecal samples longitudinally collected from IBD or non-IBD participants for 1-year.


# Purpose
- Aim of this project is to figure out the microbial dynamics with special interest on appearance of potential oncobacteirum F. nucleatum.
- Assessing chronological changes in microbiome over time, we try to identify novel biomarkers for CRC even at the healthy or mild stage of gut.


# Methodology
- Assuming transient colonizaiton of F. nucleatum (detected only 41 out of 1526 samples) as dysbiotic initiation point, we screened particular microbes that changed before or after the F. nucleatum occurences.
- Using "classifier" microbes that successfully differentiate F. nucleatum prior versus posterior samples, logistic regression models were generated, and tested into F. nucleatum-inexperienced subjects.
