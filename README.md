# F.nucleatum-project
Longitudinal analysis on fecal metagenomes of IBD and non-IBD subjects in a F. nucleuatm-oriented perspective


# Explanation
- This project was desigend and performed by JW Huh with advices from TY Roh at POSTECH.
- This project used public database provided by integrative Human Microbiome Project (iHMP, http://ihmp.org)
- The resource is whole genome sequencing data of fecal samples longitudinally collected from IBD or non-IBD participants for 1-year.


# Purpose
- Primary goal of this project is to understand microbial dynamics with special interest on the appearance of potential oncobacteirum F. nucleatum.
- Analyzing chronological changes of microbiome over time, we tried to identify novel biomarkers for early gut dysbiosis.


# Methodology
- Assuming transient colonizaiton of F. nucleatum (detected only 41 out of 1526 samples) as a clue of dysbiosis, we screened relatively abundance "classifier" microbes that specifically alters at the point of F. nucleatum occurences.
- Using potent "classifiers", multiple logistic regression models were generated, and applied to F. nucleatum-inexperienced subjects and independent healthy dataset from HMP1.
